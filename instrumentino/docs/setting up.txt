To install kivy, follow the instructions here: https://kivy.org/#download.

As described in one of the guides (depending on your OS), install the following packages under kivy:
- numpy
- pyserial
- construct
- kivy-garden
In mac you do it by typing: kivy -m pip install <modulename>

After that, make sure you install the following garden packages:
- graph
- navigationdrawer
In mac you do it by typing: garden install <modulename>
In order for the garden command to work, you need to activate the right venv:
	source /Applications/Kivy.app/Contents/Resources/venv/bin/activate
	garden install <modulename>
	deactivate
 
An additional step for mac users: you need to copy the installed garden packages into the kivy application.
Copy the "garden" folder from ~/.kivy/ to /Applications/Kivy.app/Contents/Resources/.kivy/, as explained here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kivy-users/WzkezyqS3MA

If you want to install a garden package inside instrumentino, this is how to do it:
	cd myapp
	garden install --app graph
